This is a program that I developed for a business statistics project.
It finds artists that have touring data on SongKick.com, finds all of their concerts, and scrapes those
	pages for information on the concerts.
The result is an excel document with the links to the concerts with complete information and relevant info
	on their pricing, date, venue capacity, artist popularity, and location.

The program can be run from the Main class in mainCrawler.
